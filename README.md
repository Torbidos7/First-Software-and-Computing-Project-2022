# First-Software-and-Computing-Project-2022

The aim of this first Software and Computing for Applied Physics' project is to implement a **simple cellular automata** (based on the rules detailed by *Wolfram*) and to get comfortable with the Git-Hub ambient. The working-team is composed by Lorenzo Barsotti, Daniele Buschi and Keivan Amini.

In this project, the algorithm implemented is the so-called *Rule 30*, for which we can use [Mathworld Wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule30.html) as a reference. Moreover, the methods used to implement the algorithm are inspired by this [blog](https://faingezicht.com/articles/2017/01/23/wolfram/).

For the rules detailed by *Wolfram*, the system is represented by a string of 0 and empty spaces that represent alive and dead cells. One of the most important concept is that the evolution is based on the status of each character and its neighbours.
